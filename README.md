# ðŸ“Š Product Mix Optimization using Linear Programming

This project demonstrates how to solve a classic **Product Mix Optimization** problem using **Linear Programming** in Python, with the help of the [PuLP](https://coin-or.github.io/pulp/) library.

## ðŸ§© Problem Statement

A factory manufactures two products: **Product A** and **Product B**. Each product requires certain amounts of **material** and **labor**, both of which are limited resources. The objective is to determine the optimal number of units of each product to produce in order to **maximize total profit**, while not exceeding the available resources.

### ðŸ”§ Problem Details

| Resource  | Requirement per Unit A | Requirement per Unit B | Availability |
|-----------|------------------------|-------------------------|--------------|
| Material  | 2 units                | 1 unit                  | 100 units    |
| Labor     | 1 unit                 | 2 units                 | 80 hours     |
| Profit    | $40                    | $30                     | â€”            |

## âœ… Solution Approach

The problem is modeled as a **Linear Programming (LP)** problem:

- **Decision Variables**:
  - `xA`: units of Product A to produce
  - `xB`: units of Product B to produce

- **Objective Function**:
  - Maximize `40 * xA + 30 * xB`

- **Constraints**:
  - `2 * xA + 1 * xB â‰¤ 100` (Material)
  - `1 * xA + 2 * xB â‰¤ 80` (Labor)
  - `xA, xB â‰¥ 0`

The problem is solved using the **CBC Solver** via the PuLP library.
